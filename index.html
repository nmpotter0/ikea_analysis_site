            <p>
                Louisville, Kentucky, has had IKEA rumors. <a href="http://insiderlouisville.com/business/mbb-21/">An Insider Louisville article</a> covering the topic was pessimistic claiming that the Louisville area woud not provide the population that the existing West Chester, Ohio location reaches. I wanted to put this to the test. Adapting a script for isochrone maps created by <a href="http://drewfustin.com/isochrones/">Drew Fustin</a>, I was able to create a visualization of existing IKEA locations and their corresponding one and two hour drive times. Joining these isochrones with Census tracts gave populations located within these drive times. (2014 ACS used & tracts within range of multiple locations were joined to the closest location.)

                As demonstrated below, measuring up to the wide reach of IKEA West Chester is a tall task.<br>

            <p>
                <br><br>Next, I wanted to compare potential IKEA locations in the US. I considered cities outside of existing 1 hour drive times with populations of at least 200,000, and created isochrone maps for the each city. I then measured three metrics- potential population new to a 2 hour drive time, population previously within a 2 hour drive that would potentially be within a 1 hour drive, and potential population new to a 1 hour drive time. I created a weighted score to determine the potential for new visits to IKEA scores- (2* new 1 hour drive population, 1* upgraded from 2 to 1 hour population, 1* new 2 hour population)

            <p>Potential added populations are shown below. (The 2 hour category includes the potential population within a 2 hour drive but outside a 1 hour drive.)<p>

    		<p>
    			The calculated weighted scores reflect the potential for locations throughout the south. Cities in North Carolina, Nashville, Birmingham, and New Orleans were all among the highest scoring cities. Louisville possesses a fairly high score, but lags behind in the potential population that could be reached within a one hour drive.<br><br><br><br>
